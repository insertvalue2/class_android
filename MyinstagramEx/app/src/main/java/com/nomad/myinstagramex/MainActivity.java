Too bad his next hit was 25 years later. John Otway's career is an educational, yet magical lesson in self-promoting - recruiting his fans for endless manipulative, over-the-top projects which, among others, garnered him status as The Nation's 7th Favourite Lyricist in a BBC poll, secured him a Top Ten Hit for his 50th birthday and a feature film for his 60th.
